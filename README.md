4. Response Generation 
   - dialect handling (omani_arabic dialect)
   - Prompt Templates (CBT + Spiritual + Cultural)
   - Dual LLM (OpenAI + Claude fallback)
   ‚Üì
5. Safety Mechanism & Filtering
   - Suicide risk detection
   - Harmful intent filtering
   - Escalation + Referral protocols
   ‚Üì

## Modular Pipeline
voice_input, transcriber, emotion_intent, intent_classifier, response_generator, etc.that makes the app maintainable and testable.

**1.Multithreaded Emotion & Intent Detection**
Running emotion and intent detection in parallel threads to save latency ‚Äî clever optimization.

**2.Contextual Prompting + History**
Keeping recent user interaction context and feeding it into the LLM shows that you're enabling multi-turn conversations, which is critical for therapeutic bots.

 **3.Safety Check**
Having safety.detect_risk() and halting response generation for suicidal ideation is essential for mental health apps. This shows you‚Äôre considering ethical safeguards.

**4.TTS with Emotion Control**
Using voice_tone from emotion detection to generate emotionally adaptive Arabic voice output shows attention to user empathy and localization.

**5.Privacy Policy & Logging**
Including a user-visible privacy policy and logging interactions with memory.remember_interaction() ‚Äî great for audit and research use cases.

**6.Exception-Handling**
Robust try-except blocks throughout the app ensure graceful error recovery and improved user experience.

**7.LLM Fallback Mechanism**
Automatically switches from GPT-4o to Claude Opus if the primary model fails or returns low confidence output, ensuring high response reliability.

**8.Docker Support**
Fully containerized with a production-ready Dockerfile for seamless deployment across environments.

 ## Techniques Used in the AI Chatbot:
**Prompt Engineering (Role/System Prompting)**
- Defines the assistant as a culturally-aware therapist using empathetic, Gulf Arabic, and therapeutic tone.
- Enables the chatbot to code-switch between Arabic and English as needed.

**LLM-Based Emotion & Intent Detection**
- Uses Groq's LLaMA3-70B to analyze user messages and return emotion (e.g., "ŸÇŸÑŸÇ") and intent (e.g., "ÿßÿ≥ÿ™ÿ¥ÿßÿ±ÿ©").

 **Dialect Adaptation via Dictionary Lookup**
-Translates Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) to Omani dialect using a small curated dataset ‚Äî helps localize responses naturally.

**Fallback and Latency Optimization**
- Uses both GPT-4o and Claude Sonnet, switching automatically if one fails ‚Äî improves reliability and speed.

**Natural Dialogue Memory**
- Maintains conversation history to generate context-aware, multi-turn responses like a real therapist
