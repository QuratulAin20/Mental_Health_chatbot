# üïå Mental Health Voice Bot
*Culturally-aware, voice-based mental health assistant for real-time counselling support in Omani Arabic*

A culturally-sensitive, real-time Arabic voice chatbot built with Flask, designed to provide therapeutic-grade support in the **Omani dialect**. It includes speech recognition, emotional intelligence, spiritual integration, and Arabic emotional TTS output for fully voice-based therapy.

## Application Data Flow
Modular Pipeline
voice_input, transcriber, emotion_intent, intent_classifier, response_generator, etc.that makes the app maintainable and testable.

**1.Multithreaded Emotion & Intent Detection**
Running emotion and intent detection in parallel threads to save latency ‚Äî clever optimization.

**2.Contextual Prompting + History**
Keeping recent user interaction context and feeding it into the LLM shows that you're enabling multi-turn conversations, which is critical for therapeutic bots.

 **3.Safety Check**
Having safety.detect_risk() and halting response generation for suicidal ideation is essential for mental health apps. This shows you‚Äôre considering ethical safeguards.

**4.TTS with Emotion Control**
Using voice_tone from emotion detection to generate emotionally adaptive Arabic voice output shows attention to user empathy and localization.

**5.Privacy Policy & Logging**
Including a user-visible privacy policy and logging interactions with memory.remember_interaction() ‚Äî great for audit and research use cases.

**6.Exception-Handling**
Robust try-except blocks throughout the app ensure graceful error recovery and improved user experience.

**7.LLM Fallback Mechanism**
Automatically switches from GPT-4o to Claude Opus if the primary model fails or returns low confidence output, ensuring high response reliability.

**8.Docker Support**
Fully containerized with a production-ready Dockerfile for seamless deployment across environments.

## Evaluation
- Model Latency: Tracked in real-time, shown on UI.
- Model Comparison: Claude Opus vs GPT-4o response logs + evaluation sheet.
- Emotion Vocab: Maps detected feelings to response tones (e.g., "ŸÇŸÑŸÇ" ‚Üí calm tone).
- Prompt Tuning: Uses instruct-style prompt design for both clinical and Islamic framing.

## Privacy & Consent
- Users are shown a privacy policy on entry.
- Consent to record, transcribe, and analyze voice data is required.
- Suicide triggers are handled with a clear crisis message, optionally integrated with escalation.
